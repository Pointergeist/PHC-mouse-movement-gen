# Pointergeist's Human Cursor: Mouse Movement Generator for Human-Like Mouse Trajectories

Pointergeist's Human Cursor is a Python-based emulator that generates realistic human-like mouse cursor trajectories. Built on mathematical models derived from real human motion datasets
(sigma log normal), it offers customizable trajectory and velocity profiles for applications like anti-bot testing, automation, and UX research.
